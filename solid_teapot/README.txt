I had implemented  task 1 and task 3 before mid exam and now i have implemented task 2 and task 4.

a.Yes, I have discussed about the project with Rumman Ahmed Prodhan about the Mouse based camera control. But I can't solve it properly. Only the zoom in and zoom out works. 
   

b. Yes, i have taken helps from few websites to clear out my concept regarding the functions.

c. Yes, I faced some problem when i implemented the task 4 which is mouse based camera control. here, i only implemented the zoom in or zoom out function based on the camera perspective but not rotate function. If i had a little more time, maybe i could work on it a little more. 

d. Yes, While I was trying to solve this assignment i use extra case in key function which is 'e' for controlling two function of task 4 these are zoom and rotation. when i press 'e' it will work for rotation and by default it will work for zoom in or zoom out. I also used 'o' key to set the teapot to the original view because after zoom in or zoom out or rotation it takes time to get back to the origin. but when i pressed 'o', it resets the objet but reduce the teapot size.

e. It would be better if all the functionalities related to this assignment are briefed in lab. 
  Because I faced little bit difficulties while I was applying the online instructions.
